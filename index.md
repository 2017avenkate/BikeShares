## Passholder Type Distribution

</p>

From the data set, there was a total of 81304 monthly passes, 9517 flex passes, 41224 walk-up passes, and 382 staff annual passes counted. Looking at the pie chart, it seems the majority of bike share riders prefer the monthly pass which costs $17/month and comes with free 30 minute or less bike rides with an additional $1.75 for every 30 minutes thereafter. This could be because the distance from the starting bike share station to the end station for regular riders took less than 30 minutes resulting in free rides after the initial $17/month payment.

## Trip Route Distribution

</p>

From the data set, there was a total of 119642 one way trips and 12785 round trips counted. There was a huge majority in favor of one way trips compared to round trips. This could be the result of free 30 minute or less bike rides because a round trip would take more time and would therefore be more risky for riders with monthly passes who don't want to pay additional fees.

## Average Trip Time

</p>

The average duration of renting a bike for a single trip was 25 minutes. This makes a lot of sense because the majority of bike share riders want to limit their bike ride to 30 minutes or less.

# Seasonal Effect on Passholder Types

</p>

From the graph, we can see the season does not seem to affect the passholder types very much. We can see the total number of people who use bike shares is the most in the fall and the least in the spring. However, the dataset provided was only from 07/07/2016 to 03/31/2017. This meant a significant number of days in the summer and the spring were not accounted for. Spring was the most affected because both the months of April and May did not have any data available. Winter having less riders than summer, which was not completely accounted for, and fall makes sense because with colder temperatures fewer people will use the bike share services.

The calculated percentages for the passholder types for each season was the following:

Monthly passes in the summer: 63.39%

Flex passes in the summer: 9.14%

Walk-up passes in the summer: 27.47%

Staff annual passes in the summer: 0%


Monthly passes in the fall: 58.7%

Flex passes in the fall: 6.38%

Walk-up passes in the fall: 34.45%

Staff annual passes in the fall: 0.48%


Monthly passes in the spring: 60.77%

Flex passes in the spring: 7.36%

Walk-up passes in the spring: 31.87%

Staff annual passes in the spring: 0%


Monthly passes in the winter: 64%

Flex passes in the winter: 6.22%

Walk-up passes in the winter: 29.35%

Staff annual passes in the winter: 0.43%

Looking at the percentages, the monthly passes was always around 60%, the flex passes always around 7%, the walk-up passes always around 30% and the staff annual passes always around 0.2%. The season itself did not effect the type of pass purchased by the bike share riders significantly.
